/// Opaque type that represents a Lua thread, which is used by
/// [`Lua`](crate::Lua) and other structures.
/// 
/// This type can never have an instance made of it; there can only be
/// references to this type, which are the only kind of valid value.
/// 
/// # Borrowing
/// Most methods use `&mut Thread` as `&Thread`, even though, at least
/// *in theory*, they should've borrowed mutably with `&mut Thread`.
/// For instance, [`Thread::push_nil`], even though it modifies the Lua stack by
/// pushing a `nil`, still borrows a [`Thread`] immutably.
/// 
/// In the case for this structure, borrowing immutably means **not in any way
/// being able to trigger the GC to collect garbage**.
/// Any references returned by methods for this structure are simply the same
/// pointers that the C API returns, though they are converted to references for
/// the Rust borrow checker to ensure safety.
/// The Lua garbage collector will not invalidate any pointers if it is stopped.
/// 
/// To call API functions that can potentially enable the GC, it is required
/// that any references that have been acquired previously from a [`Thread`] are
/// immediately invalidated, so they cannot be used *if* the garbage collector
/// decides to collect them.
/// This is done by borrowing [`Thread`] mutably once, through
/// [`Thread::managed`], which allows for more operations.
/// 
/// The main reason for this model existing is because it may be difficult to
/// formally prove that a reference would not be collected without using stack
/// indices. This model simply utilizes checks done at compile time to ensure
/// safety.
/// 
/// # Memory layout
/// This type has the same in-memory representation as [`lua_State`];
/// however, it is always used behind a reference.
