	///   The hook is called just before Lua leaves the function.
	/// - The **line** hook is called when the interpreter is about to start the execution of a new line of code,
	///   or when it jumps back in the code (even to the same line).
	///   This event only happens while Lua is executing a Lua function.
	/// - The **count** hook is called after the interpreter executes every `count` instructions.
